I will not add the bridge,"While there is potential for increased benefits through creating a connection, there is a risk that the other decision-maker might choose not to modify the network. In this case, adding a connection would disadvantage the other party remaining at only 1 point while I earn 8, which feels unfair and would decrease overall harmony in the group.
