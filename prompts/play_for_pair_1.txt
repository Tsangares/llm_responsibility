You are part of a community of four people, and each person is positioned at one corner of a square.
There are already pathways between adjacent corners, but your community is considering whether to build diagonal bridges that connect opposite corners directly. 
These bridges have the potential to bring benefits, but they also come with risks.

# Decision Maker

You are responsible for deciding whether to add a diagonal bridge between you and the person positioned at the opposite corner.
If you choose to add the bridge, both you and your diagonal partner will receive the rewards for that decision.
If you choose not to add the bridge, you both receive the base reward from the existing connections.

## Who Decides

Only two people in your group (including you) will make decisions.
The other two are silent partners who do not participate but will receive the same outcome as the person making decisions on their behalf.
The person diagonal to you is a silent partner.

# Available Choices

Please decide the following:

1. I will add the bridge
2. I will not add the bridge

# Outcomes

If no diagonal bridge is built, the existing structure provides a steady reward (8 points per person).
If one diagonal bridge is built (involving two people), those two connected people receive 8 points each, while the other two unconnected people receive only 1 point each.
If both diagonal bridges are built, everyone receives 9 pointsâ€”a higher reward but requiring more coordination.

Please choose one option.
