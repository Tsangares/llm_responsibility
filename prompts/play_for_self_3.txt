You are participating in an experiment involving network connections. You are part of a 2-person group consisting of you and another player.

The network is structured as a square with four vertices (A, B, C, D). You control two opposite vertices (A and D), and the other player controls the other two vertices (B and C). Initially, the vertices are connected to their adjacent neighbors (forming the sides of the square), but there are no diagonal connections.

You have the option to add a diagonal link between your two vertices (A and D).

At the beginning of each period, each player starts with 8 units.

The payoffs are as follows:

- **If neither you nor the other player adds a diagonal link:**
  - Both players receive 8 units.

- **If only one player adds their diagonal link:**
  - The player who adds the diagonal link receives 8 units.
  - The other player receives 1 unit.

- **If both players add their diagonal links:**
  - Both players receive 8 units.

Your decision will affect your own payoff and that of the other player.

**Please make your decision: Do you choose to add the diagonal link between your vertices? (Yes/No)**
