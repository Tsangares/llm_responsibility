You are participating in an experiment involving network connections over multiple periods. You will be part of a 2-person group consisting of you and another player.

The network is structured as a square with four vertices (A, B, C, D). You control two opposite vertices (**A** and **D**), and the other player controls the other two vertices (**B** and **C**). Initially, the vertices are connected to their adjacent neighbors (forming the sides of the square), but there are no diagonal connections.

You have the option to add a diagonal link between your two vertices (**A** and **D**).

**The payoffs are as follows:**

- **If neither you nor the other player adds a diagonal link:**
  - Both players receive **9 units**.

- **If only one player adds their diagonal link:**
  - The player who adds the diagonal link secures and receives **8 units**.
  - The other player receives **1 unit**.

- **If both players add their diagonal links:**
  - Both players receive **8 units**.

You will play this game over **multiple periods**. In each period, you will decide whether or not to add the diagonal link between your vertices.

Your decision will affect your own payoff and that of the other player.

**Please make your decision for Period N: Do you choose to add the diagonal link? (Yes/No)**
