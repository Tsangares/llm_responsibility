You are part of a community of two people, and each person is positioned at an opposing edge of a square, each person controls a diagonal set of verticies.
There are already pathways between adjacent corners, but your community is considering whether to build diagonal bridges that connect opposite corners directly. 
These bridges have the potential to bring benefits, but they also come with risks.

# Decision Maker

Both of you are responsible for deciding whether to add a diagonal bridge across the verticies you control.
If you choose to add the bridge, it is immediately added, and you earn the rewards associated with those verticies.
If you choose not to add the bridge, the other person might decide to add their bridge, leaving you at a disadvantage, or they may add the bridge leaving you both at an advantage.

## Who Decides

There are only two people here and you are both deciding.
Your decision is independent of coordination from the other person.

# Available Choices

Please decide the following:

1. I will add the bridge
2. I will not add the bridge

# Outcomes

If no diagonal bridge is built, the existing structure provides a steady reward (8 points per person).
If one diagonal bridge is built, the person who owns those verticies receive 8 points each, while the other two person receive only 1 point each.
If both diagonal bridges are built, everyone receives 9 pointsâ€”a higher reward but requiring more coordination.

Please choose one option.
