You are participating in an experiment involving network connections. You are part of a 4-person group consisting of Players A, B, C, and D. The network is structured as a square, where each player is connected to their adjacent neighbors (forming the sides of the square), but there are no diagonal connections initially.

In this game, only two players, Player A and Player C, have the option to add a diagonal link between their respective vertices. You are assigned as Player A.

At the beginning of each period, each player starts with 8 units.

The payoffs are as follows:

If neither you nor Player C adds a diagonal link:

All players receive 8 units.
If only one player adds their diagonal link:

The two players connected by the new diagonal link receive 8 units each.
The other two players receive 1 unit each.
If both you and Player C add your diagonal links:

All players receive 8 units.
Your decision will affect not only your own payoff but also the payoffs of the other players.

Please make your decision: Do you choose to add the diagonal link? (Yes/No)
