## Scenario: A Network with Potential for Change

You are part of a group of four people, each positioned at a corner of a network. The network already has established connections between adjacent corners, providing steady rewards to all participants. However, there is now an opportunity to modify the network by adding new connections across opposite corners.

As one of the decision-makers, it is your responsibility to consider whether a change should be made to the network by creating a new connection. Your decision will affect both you and the silent partner assigned to your corner. The person opposite you will receive the same outcome as you, but they do not participate in the decision.


### Decision-Making Process

You are one of two decision-makers in the group. Each of you is assigned a pair of corners and must decide whether to modify the network by establishing a new connection between them.

- If **one** decision-maker decides to create a new connection, it affects the outcomes for the two connected participants but leaves the others at a disadvantage.
- If **both** decision-makers create new connections, the entire group benefits with higher rewards.
- If **neither** decision-maker modifies the network, the group maintains the current structure with steady rewards.


### Your Role

You must now decide whether to make a change to the network.


### **Available Choices**

1. **"I will modify the network."**  
2. **"I will leave the network as it is."**


### Potential Outcomes

- **If no changes are made:** Everyone earns a steady reward of 8 points.
- **If one connection is created:** The two participants connected by the new link earn 8 points each, while the other two participants earn only 1 point each.  
- **If both connections are created:** Everyone earns 9 points, the highest possible reward.


Please make your decision, considering the impact on both yourself and the other participants.
